## 1. Overview

In the Week 2 lab, you worked with a Flask REST API that performs CRUD operations on a `users` resource. In this assignment, you will extend that API by adding a second resource (`tasks`) that has a relationship with users.

This simulates a real-world scenario where APIs manage multiple related resources. You will also deploy your API to Azure App Service and demonstrate its functionality through a video recording.

---

## 2. Learning Objectives

Upon successful completion of this assignment, you will be able to:

| # | Objective |
|---|-----------|
| 1 | Demonstrate understanding of RESTful API design principles |
| 2 | Extend an existing Flask API with new functionality |
| 3 | Implement proper HTTP methods, status codes, and error handling |
| 4 | Test API endpoints using the REST Client extension |
| 5 | Deploy a REST API to Azure App Service |

---

## 3. Requirements

This assignment consists of five parts.

### 3.1 Part 1: Add a Tasks Resource

Extend the Flask API to include a new `tasks` resource with the following endpoints:

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Success Code |
|----------|--------|-------------|--------------|
| `/tasks` | GET | Retrieve all tasks | 200 |
| `/tasks/<id>` | GET | Retrieve a single task by ID | 200 |
| `/tasks` | POST | Create a new task | 201 |
| `/tasks/<id>` | PUT | Update an existing task | 200 |
| `/tasks/<id>` | DELETE | Delete a task | 204 |

#### 3.1.1 Task Data Structure

Each task must contain the following fields:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Complete Assignment 1",
  "description": "Extend the REST API with tasks",
  "user_id": 1,
  "completed": false
}
```

**Field Specifications:**

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `id` | integer | Auto | — | Unique identifier (auto-generated) |
| `title` | string | Yes | — | Task title |
| `description` | string | No | `""` | Task description |
| `user_id` | integer | Yes | — | Must reference an existing user |
| `completed` | boolean | No | `false` | Task completion status |

#### 3.1.2 Validation Requirements

Your API must handle the following error cases with appropriate HTTP status codes:

| Scenario | Response Code |
|----------|---------------|
| Task not found | 404 Not Found |
| Missing required field (`title` or `user_id`) | 400 Bad Request |
| Invalid `user_id` (user doesn't exist) | 400 Bad Request |
| Invalid JSON in request body | 400 Bad Request |

#### 3.1.3 Initial Data

Include at least two sample tasks in your in-memory data store:

```python
tasks = [
    {"id": 1, "title": "Learn REST", "description": "Study REST principles", "user_id": 1, "completed": True},
    {"id": 2, "title": "Build API", "description": "Complete the assignment", "user_id": 2, "completed": False},
]
```

---

### 3.2 Part 2: Add a User-Tasks Endpoint

Add an endpoint to retrieve all tasks assigned to a specific user:

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Success Code |
|----------|--------|-------------|--------------|
| `/users/<id>/tasks` | GET | Retrieve all tasks for a specific user | 200 |

**Behavior:**
- Return `404 Not Found` if the user does not exist
- Return an empty list `[]` if the user exists but has no tasks

---

### 3.3 Part 3: API Testing File

Create a file named `test-tasks-api.http` that tests all your new endpoints.

Your testing file must include the following nine test cases:

| # | Test Case | Expected Result |
|---|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 | GET all tasks | 200 with tasks array |
| 2 | GET a single task | 200 with task object |
| 3 | GET a task that doesn't exist | 404 |
| 4 | POST a new task (valid data) | 201 with created task |
| 5 | POST a task with missing title | 400 |
| 6 | POST a task with invalid user_id | 400 |
| 7 | PUT to update a task | 200 with updated task |
| 8 | DELETE a task | 204 |
| 9 | GET tasks for a specific user | 200 with user's tasks |

Refer to `test-api.http` in the Week 2 lab repository for file format examples.

---

### 3.4 Part 4: Deploy to Azure App Service

Deploy your extended API to Azure App Service so it is publicly accessible. Refer to the Week 2 lab repository for deployment instructions.

> **Important:** Delete all Azure resources immediately after recording your video demo to avoid unexpected charges. Your video serves as proof that the deployment worked.

---

### 3.5 Part 5: Video Demo

Create a short video demonstration showing your API running on Azure.

#### 3.5.1 Video Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Length** | Maximum 5 minutes |
| **Audio** | Not required (silent is acceptable) |
| **Upload** | YouTube (unlisted) |
| **Content** | Screen recording showing your API being tested |

#### 3.5.2 Video Content

Your video must demonstrate the following:

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1 | Open your Azure URL in a browser to show the welcome message |
| 2 | Run your `test-tasks-api.http` file against your Azure URL |
| 3 | Show at least one error case (e.g., POST with invalid `user_id`) |

> **Tip:** Before recording, update your `test-tasks-api.http` to use your Azure URL:
> ```http
> ### 1. Get all tasks
> GET https://your-app-name.azurewebsites.net/tasks
> ```

#### 3.5.3 Recording Tools

- [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) (free, cross-platform)

#### 3.5.4 Uploading to YouTube

1. Go to [YouTube Studio](https://studio.youtube.com/)
2. Click **Create** → **Upload video**
3. Set visibility to **Unlisted** (only people with the link can view)
4. Copy the video URL for your Brightspace submission

---

## 6. Academic Integrity

This assignment **permits** and **encourages** the use of generative AI tools as per the course outline. I suggest using AI in **agent mode** (e.g., Claude Code, GitHub Copilot Agent) to assist with development.

**If you use AI assistance, you must:**

1. Disclose its use in a comment at the top of your code
2. Understand and be able to explain all code you submit
3. Ensure the code works correctly — AI-generated code with bugs will lose marks

**Example disclosure:**
```python
# AI Disclosure: Claude Code was used in agent mode to assist with
# implementing the tasks CRUD endpoints.
```

For complete details, refer to the **Course Policy on Generative AI Use** in the course outline.

## 7. Late Submission Policy

| Condition | Penalty |
|-----------|---------|
| Up to 5 days late | 10% per day |
| More than 5 days late | Not accepted (grade of 0) |

**Final acceptance deadline:** February 11, 2026 at 11:59 PM
